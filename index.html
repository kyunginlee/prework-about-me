      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm a first gen Korean-Australian and moved to Australia when I was very little.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Trying to make Muay Thai stick, taking Ella my 8 year old collie cross puppy out on day trips with my partner Tom, and trying out short motion graphics courses.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be a bivalve connoisseur.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I recently moved to Enfield, a small suburb near Burwood</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I would love to have the ability to work from anywhere, different cities, countries, on the road, home or office and I think this skillset reflects the mobility and accessibility I'm looking for in my next role.</p>
